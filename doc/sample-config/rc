# blocked sites. But as blocked sites detection is not reliable, you may need
# to manually examine the recorded site lists.
# So if you care about performance very much, it's recommend to enable them
# and use COW for a while to get your frequently visited sites recorded. After
# fixing uncorrectly recorded direct/blocked sites, disable updateDirect and 
# updateBlocked to avoid recording too much (and possibly wrong) sites in
# auto-direct/blocked.
